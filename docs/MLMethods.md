# Machine Learning Methods we will utilize: TensorFlow and Keras

---

We plan to directly translate users American Sign Language gestures done in their devices camera through pattern recognition of the gestures themselves. Using a machine learning model, it will be trained on images or video frames of hand signs along with their meanings, allowing the model to directly translate ASL inputs in its final state.


## TensorFlow - Acts as the main platform for building our MLM
# Why we chose TensorFlow:

- Beginner friendly, open-source, low level machine learning framework. Will not be complicated to learn
- Very compatible with Keras as TensorFlow has many of its features integrated directly with it
- Allows for the training of neural networks


## Keras - High level API that supports
# Why we chose Keras:

- It is built into the TensorFlow library, minimizing the hassle of managing multiple platforms
- Simplifies the process of building and training models
- Makes experimentation faster as aspects of the model can be changed through Keras
- Multiple sources and guides on how to navigate and use it ,lessening the learning curve.
- Multiple options for feeding database information ASL information into the learning model (Numpy arrays, pandas, etc)


## How TensorFlow and Keras work together for ASL pattern recognition

- Keras will define and train the neural network of the machine learning model
- TensorFlow allows for the handling of underlying computations in order to process image data efficiently for the learning-models training
- The team can put more focus on the models design and training since aspects like performance will be operated by TensorFlow


## Team Discussion:

Initially, we as a team had already decided on TensorFlow as an option for building the machine learning model to translate. With this as an option, using the Keras API became associated with TensorFlow as they operate closely and are also utilized for image based data. Further researching both led us to concluding that they were our best choices as they can still be utilized by people who are new to building and training machine language models.
